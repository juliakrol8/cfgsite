        <p>Brussels is the capital city of Belgium. It is known as the "Heart of Europe". It has 3 main languages: French, Flemmish and English so locals call it <em>Bruxelles</em> and <em>Brussel</em>.</p>
        <p>It is where the European Comission is based. Famous for their beers, waffles, chocolate, french fries and a statue of a little boy going to the toilet!</p>
        <p>The administrative capital of the EU, Brussels is historic yet hip, bureaucratic yet bizarre, self confident yet unshowy, and multicultural to its roots. All this plays out in a cityscape that swings from majestic to quirky to rundown and back again. Organic art nouveau facades face off against 1960s concrete developments, and regal 19th-century mansions contrast with the brutal glass of the EU’s Gotham City. This whole maelstrom swirls out from Brussels’ medieval core, where the Grand Place is surely one of the world’s most beautiful squares.</p>

          <h3>Culture</h3>

          <p>Brussels culture centres around great food and entertainment from both festivals and bars. Brussels is known to be the culture capital of Europe.</p>
          <p>The city has also been enriched by a host of foreign cultural influences, which means there is always something to catch your imagination. Being home to thirty independent theatres upholds Brussels’ name as a mecca of the performing arts. Thus, the National Orchestra and the National Opera House are a must-see upon a visit to this city. Apart from lively alternative rock venues, jazzy crowds and classical music halls, all varieties of cutting-edge arts are popular in this European capital.</p>
          <p>The city is home to many nationalities and the diversity of cultures have shaped the city's culture over time. Belgium’s culture blends the Flemish North and the French South to produce something very closely resembling the Parisian style, but slightly off-beat. The Belgians have a particular affinity towards the visual arts and performances, and are invariably involved in multiple forms of theatre, opera, ballet and stage music.</p>

          <p>Currently around 80% of the population in Brussels speak French as their first language. This is the language most used on the streets of Brussels and in most establishments – restaurants, bars, major shopping centres, tourist attractions, museums. A large number of people in the service industry also speak English but not all so there are times when you will need to use some hand gestures or ask if someone speaks English. It is still handy to know some travel phrases in French upon arriving.</p>
          <p>What’s the difference between Dutch and Flemish? Dutch is the root language of Flemish, which could be called a dialect or local version of Dutch. It is a language that originates from the Netherlands. Dutch speakers from the Netherlands and Dutch speakers in Belgium may not be able to communicate fluently with each other because Flemish uses different nouns, different pronunciation and has evolved at a different pace from modern Dutch.</p>
