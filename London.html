          <p>The culture of London concerns the engineering, music, museums, festivals and other entertainment in the city. London is widely believed to be the culture capital of the world, although this title is disputed with a number of other cities internationally. The city is particularly renowned for its theatre quarter, and its West End theatre district has given the name to "West End theatre", the strand of mainstream professional theatre staged in the large theatres in London. London is
          also home to notable cultural attractions such as the British Museum, the Tate Galleries, the National Gallery, the Notting Hill Carnival and The O2.</p>
          <p>Through music, comedy and theatre, London has a lively nightlife with approximately 25.6 events per thousand people, 44.1% of those events being theatre based.</p>
          <p>A variety of landmarks and objects are cultural icons associated with London, such as Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and the tube map. Many other British cultural icons are strongly associated with London in the minds of visiting tourists, including the red telephone box, the AEC Routemaster bus, the black taxi and the Union Flag.</p>
          <p>The city is home to many nationalities and the diversity of cultures have shaped the city's culture over time.</p>

            <li>Top British dishes</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Fish & Chips</li>
                  <img class="img_food" src="http://www.hurtwoodparkpolo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Traditional-fish-and-chips-cut-600x400.jpg" alt="Fish&Chips">
                  <p class="p_food">There’s nothing that says ‘British Food’ like Fish & Chips. Known the world over, this traditional British dish is on the top of any foodie list for visitors to London and the U.K. Although fish & chips is best eaten on the seaside (think Brighton, Blackpool or Whitby) it is possible to get great fish & chips in London. Fish & chips is traditionally eaten with mushy peas and garnished with salt and vinegar!</p>
                <li>Beef Wellington</li>
                  <img class="img_food" src="https://realfood.tesco.com/media/images/BEEF-WELLINGTON-HERO-efd7dbab-d3ba-4e68-a175-b87755092fb8-0-472x310.jpg" alt="Beef Wellington">
                  <p class="p_food">Perhaps the item with the most British name on the list, beef wellington is made up of filet steak, oftentimes covered with pate, which is then wrapped in puff pastry and cooked. Moorish, flaky and filling, beef wellington is a standard British classic, despite the fact it is now believed that the dish was NOT named after the Duke of Wellington, but instead after the town of Wellington, New Zealand. But we won’t say anything if you don’t!</p>
                <li>Sunday Roast with Yorkshire Pudding</li>
                  <img class="img_food" src="https://d22ir9aoo7cbf6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Oxwell-Co1.jpg" alt="Sunday Roast">
                  <p class="p_food">Sunday roast is a true British classic. Traditionally this meal is eaten any time from 12noon to 5pm on Sundays. Although you can get Sunday roast with turkey, beef, pork, chicken, lamb and veggie options – it’s important to always make sure you get your Yorkshire pudding! Traditionally served with beef, Yorkshire puddings a true British classic and can often be added to any Sunday roast order. A traditional roast comes with meat, potatoes, gravy and vegetables and should be so large you find it difficult to walk afterwards!</p>
                <li>Full English Breakfast</li>
                  <img class="img_food" src="https://canales.okdiario.com/recetas/img/2016/12/14/desayuno-ingles-01.jpg" alt="English Breakfast">
                  <p class="p_food">The full English breakfast is a mighty meal! Traditionally, you need to find a dish that incorporates: sausages, eggs, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, blood pudding, potatoes, and toast. Perfect for a hangover (not that we’d know!), a full English is a great traditional British dish – easy, tasty, and usually inexpensive!</p>
                <li>Cockles</li>
                  <img class="img_food" src="https://foodandforagehebrides.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cockles.jpg" alt="Cockles">
                  <p class="p_food">Oftentimes reserved for the more adventurous eaters, cockles are a small type of clam, and are traditionally associated with London’s East End where they were a cheap, staple food for decades. Today cockles can be found in grocery stores – but also in some of London’s tastiest markets!</p>
                <li>Afternoon Tea</li>
                  <img class="img_food" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/580dc1aa59cc689a7b439d53/580dc53bb3db2b51a44369ed/5a01daf78165f5b6897c889d/1510074495243/Afternoon+Tea+Web.jpg?format=750w" alt="Afternoon Tea">
                  <p class="p_food">The ultimate British tradition, afternoon tea is a fabulous way to while away the time and enjoy true British delicacies. Traditionally comprised of finger sandwiches, scones with jam and cream as well as pastries and your choice of tea, afternoon tea is meant to be an experience so make sure you reserve a couple hours to enjoy yourself! Oh, and if you’re having afternoon tea, you may as well add a glass of champagne as well!</p>

          <p>English, in various dialects, is the most widely spoken language of the United Kingdom and it is the official language spoken in London as well.</p>
          <p>The growing diversity of London’s population revealed that more than 100 different languages are spoken in virtually every borough. Statistics from the 2011 Census show that 78 per cent of the capital’s residents speak English as their main language. But the remaining 22 per cent — equivalent to just over 1.7 million people — have another first language.</p>
          <p>The most common other language is Polish, spoken as the main language by nearly two per cent of residents, followed by Bengali, Gujarati, French, Urdu and Arabic. The most diverse borough is Hillingdon, where all of the 107 languages defined by the Census are spoken, followed by Newham, where 104 languages are spoken.</p>
          <p>The map shown, is based on data from the 2011 Census, illustrates the second most commonly spoken languages in each of the London boroughs. Polish and Turkish are the second language of the highest number of London boroughs (seven and four respectively), and that some perhaps less expected languages such as Lithuanian, French and Nepalese are in fact commonly spoken in certain areas.</p>
